## Note

In this repository, I've organized the materials by week for your convenience. For questions and answers, I've used a format where answers are labeled as "True" or "False," which can also be interpreted as "Right" or "Wrong." Please review each question's summary to determine whether the answer is correct or not. 

For multiple-choice and single-choice questions, only the correct answers are provided. If you see all options selected for multiple-choice questions, it's done to show all the correct options. Please select the right answers based on that information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrinceKaKKad/Coursera-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning.git
